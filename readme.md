## Dependencys

 - Docker desktop (running, kind installs k8s cluster into docker!)
 - kubectl, kind, helm, k9s(reccomended)

## Setup dependencys on osx with homebrew

`brew cask install docker`

`brew install kubectl kind helm k9s`

`helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm`

# Quick guide

1. Install dependencys, ensure docker desktop is up and running
2. Create a git repo, change creds in repo-and-app.yaml accoringly. In case of HTTPS auth and access token you only need to change url and token.
3. Push the testapp chart template to git (to have a demo app to deploy), it was generated by `helm create testapp`
4. run ./local-cluster.sh and follow instructions
5. press sync in ArgoCD to deploy the test application


If you want to see the full helm config options (limited in helm) you can download the chart via helm pull

`argo/argo-cd --version 4.5.0`
